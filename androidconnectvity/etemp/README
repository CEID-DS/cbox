The plan is to make android services also using a public context providers(which would be helpfull to the squid team)

The android project WifiConnectivity is going to provide the information to the user about his connection the availability
of connections and plus it's going to provide information about himself via adress structure .

The bluetooth connectivity for android is going to do the same thing the bluetooth way

The Jconnectivity is a java app helping our team in debugging the android apps

In order to avoid problems considering the programming language with other teams a c++ app for debugging would be available
