This is a short  example of how i sent Sms from my pc .I use a Java app with swing for my pc using udp messages
It has to be on local network
You have to import them both on your eclipse workspace .
Warning !!!!!
Fisrt first you have to run the Pcsms project Set the phone number and the contend of your smsm 
And press the button 
Then you have to press the button on your android phone .After that everything would be ok  .
DO NOT PRESS the button on your android phone before you have set the phone number and the sms and pressed the send button 
on the pc java application because the android phone is going to wait for a udp message and then you would have to close the application and go 
from the start.
