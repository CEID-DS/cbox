You should have installed android SDK and NDK to run this app. More info: http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
Assuming that these are installed, it is higly recommended to create a soft link between <yourPathToSDK>/tools/android
and /usr/bin/android.
After loading the project into Eclipse (using the option "Create project from existing source") change from command line
to the directory where the project is and run the command "android update project -p . -s" to build the build.xml file.
To compile the native code you have to run the ndk-build script located to <yourPathToNDK>/ndk-build from the directory
in which the(your) project is (<..>/cbox/android_wiselib/hello_android). After that you can build the project using Eclipse.
Please note that if you edit the native code YOU HAVE TO run again the ndk-build script("ndk-build clean all"), clean the
project files and at last rebuild it from the scratch.
